Graph
A Graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected
by links. The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links
that connect the vertices are called edges.

A graph can be easily presented using the python dictionary data types.
We represent the vertices as the keys of the dictionary and the connection between the vertices also called edges
as the values in the dictionary.
